# CHAOSS Working Groups

CHAOSS has three types of working groups.

## 1. Metrics Working Groups
Metrics working groups are responsible for developing and maintaining metrics definitions and metrics models.

### Active Working Groups
* [**Metrics Development**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-development): This working group (formerly known as Common Metrics) focuses on defining the metrics that are used by multiple working groups or are important for community health, but that do not cleanly fit into one of the other existing metrics working groups.

* [**Diversity, Equity & Inclusion**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion): This working group aims to bring together experiences measuring diversity, equity and inclusion in open source projects.

* [**Metrics-Models**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-models): This working group develops models that include the integration of multiple CHAOSS metrics in a way that people would consume them in practice.

### Inactive Working Groups

* [**Evolution**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution): This working group was focused on refining the metrics that inform evolution and to work with open source software implementations. Future evolution metrics will be defined in the Common WG.

* [**Value**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value): This working group was focused on developing metrics that describe value of open source engagement for individuals and organizations. Discussions about value are currently happening in the OSPO WG.

* [**Risk**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-risk): This working group was focused on compliance and risk metrics in Open Source Software. Future evolution metrics will be defined in the Common WG.


## 2. Context Working Groups
Context WGs are groups of people who share similar contexts related to open source project health. Context WGs are responsible for helping put CHAOSS metrics, metrics models, and software into practice in meaningful ways across varied contexts.

* [**OSPO**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-ospo): The OSPO Metrics working group aims to advance how organizations understand the value that open source projects can provide as well as the value of these programs / initiatives. This is a joint effort between the CHAOSS project and the TODO Group.

* [**Application Ecosystem**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-app-ecosystem): This working group applies CHAOSS metrics in the context of an open-source app ecosystem. The mission of this working group is to build a base set of metrics that is focused on the needs of open source communities that are part of the FOSS app ecosystem.

* [**University / Academic**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZg8vGQOgfhK6P6G8GQse6OaN3yb2Z_IQVyINa-0TZs/edit): The University working group is a joint effort between the CHAOSS project and the OSPO++ community that aims to create a set of recommendations for metrics related to university open source software, particularly as they relate to what might be seen as “success” for university leadership, faculty, students, and staff, keeping in mind that these actors may evaluate success differently. 

* [**Science / Research**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-science): The Science working group aims create a set of recommendations for metrics and models related to scientific open source communities. 

* [**Data Science**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science): We collaborate with data scientists and researchers to shape how we understand open source community health and make it easier for people to use CHAOSS tools, metrics, and metrics models to draw meaningful insights that they can use to improve open source project health using data science-based approaches.

* [**UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17VAYItNIw_i36mCUyBs1t9fEK_Ks1vjhOJFRfIA1CjM/edit?usp=sharing): The UN SDG working group focuses on using CHAOSS metrics to help understand the role of open source projects and their progress toward achieving the UN SDGs.

## 3. Operations Working Groups

The Operations Working Groups are supporting the metrics discussions and are responsible for various activities and operations for the CHAOSS project. In the past, many of these efforts were called Initiatives.

* [**Communications**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2hErJemNCLgIBaOW0ODIdwfbgBqTfw25aJ7E1ijzWc/edit): The Communications (or Comms) working group focuses on creating outward facing communication and promoting CHAOSS engagement (new contributors, sponsors, metrics users, and CHAOSS software users) to amplify the work being done throughout the CHAOSS community by its contributors. 

* [**CHAOSScon**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HvKPfJwoZm4nW2bBVbDfN8HyFXyXsJlN9g16UhR6l-A/edit): The CHAOSScon working group focuses on planning and executing CHAOSS conferences.

* [**CHAOSScast**](https://podcast.chaoss.community/about): The CHAOSScast working group focuses on managing the CHAOSS podcast.

* [**DEI Badging**](https://github.com/badging/): The DEI Badging working group focuses on our badging initiative that is meant to encourage open source projects and event organizers to obtain our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion badges for the purposes of leadership self-reflection and self-improvement around the ways that they are centering DEI. 

* [**Website**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p079Q75RZ2Duk-nX4osXY2v3oFjqF6-BTZG6XPx8iQ4/edit#heading=h.9qd11sbe2wiy): The Website working group focus on maintenance of CHAOSS Website.
